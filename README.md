Built a narrative around a set of data, and accompanying visualizations to help convey the sense of competition between the two biggest rivalries of all times; Boeing and Airbus.

## Overview of the project 

•	Datasets of Boeing and Airbus were merged together 

•	Performed Data Wrangling to remove the noise from the data

•	New verticals were created using feature engineering for better insights 

•	Exploratory data analysis was performed using numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas

•	Selected the best visualizations to compare information, clarify meaning and put story into proper context

## Applied Skills: 

• Data Wrangling

• Exploratory Data Analysis

• Data Visualization

## NOTE - 

• I have added the notebook with the code
